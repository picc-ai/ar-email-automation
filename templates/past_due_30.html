  <title>PICC - {{STORE_NAME}} - Nabis Invoice {{INVOICE_NUMBER}} - 30+ Days Past Due</title>
  <!--
    PICC AR Email Template: 30+ DAYS PAST DUE (T3)
    =================================================
    Tier: T3 - 30+ Days Past Due
    Trigger: Invoice is 30-39 days past due
    Tone: Formal, regulatory awareness, firm but collaborative
    Urgency: MODERATE
    Attachment: Nabis ACH Payment Form.pdf
    CC Rule: Base team + sales rep + Nabis AM

    Subject Line Formula:
      PICC - {{STORE_NAME}} - Nabis Invoice {{INVOICE_NUMBER}} - 30+ Days Past Due

    ESCALATION DESIGN (IMPROVED from original identical template):
    - This is the FIRST Past Due tier: introduces OCM reporting policy
    - Mentions the 52-day hard deadline as context
    - Tone is firm but still collaborative ("we understand oversights happen")
    - Mentions payment terms as contractual obligation
    - Adds a specific payment deadline request
    - No account hold language yet (reserved for 40+)

    KEY DIFFERENCES FROM OVERDUE (T2):
    - Opener changes to formal "I hope this message finds you well"
    - Introduces AR department and OCM regulatory context
    - Mentions Nabis 45-day notification and 52-day reporting thresholds
    - Closing is longer and more formal with partnership language
    - "We kindly ask" replaces the softer T2 closing
    - Uses "Regards," sign-off instead of casual closing

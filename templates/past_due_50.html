    PICC AR Email Template: 50+ DAYS PAST DUE (T5)
    =================================================
    Tier: T5 - 50+ Days Past Due
    Trigger: Invoice is 50+ days past due
    Tone: FINAL NOTICE -- direct, consequential, no-nonsense
    Urgency: CRITICAL
    Attachment: Nabis ACH Payment Form.pdf + Invoice copy + Account statement
    CC Rule: Base team + sales rep + Nabis AR dept + store owner/AP + PICC management
    Sender: May escalate from Sales Admin to Regional Account Manager

    Subject Line Formula:
      PICC - {{STORE_NAME}} - Nabis Invoice {{INVOICE_NUMBER}} - 50+ Days Past Due - FINAL NOTICE

    ESCALATION DESIGN (IMPROVED - this was previously identical to 30+ and 40+):
    - This is the FINAL email tier before OCM reporting / collections
    - "FINAL NOTICE" language -- no more "friendly reminder" or "we understand"
    - Explicit statement that OCM reporting will happen within days
    - Account is ON HOLD for new orders
    - Mentions potential collections referral
    - "Payment is required immediately" -- no hedging
    - Empathy language REMOVED entirely
    - Deadline is not a request -- it is a requirement
    - Optional: Sender escalates to Mario Serrano (Regional Account Manager)

    KEY DIFFERENCES FROM 40+ DAYS (T4):
    - Subject line adds "FINAL NOTICE" instead of "ACTION REQUIRED"
    - "Final notice" framing replaces "second notice"
    - Account hold is no longer potential -- it IS in effect
    - Collections/legal language introduced
    - No empathy clause ("oversights happen" removed)
    - Payment is "required" not "requested"
    - Specific OCM report date calculated
    - May come from Regional Account Manager instead of Sales Admin

    PICC AR Email Template: 40+ DAYS PAST DUE (T4)
    =================================================
    Tier: T4 - 40+ Days Past Due
    Trigger: Invoice is 40-49 days past due
    Tone: Urgent, direct, firm -- potential account consequences
    Urgency: HIGH
    Attachment: Nabis ACH Payment Form.pdf + Invoice copy if available
    CC Rule: Base team + sales rep + Nabis AM (explicit) + store owner/AP if known

    Subject Line Formula:
      PICC - {{STORE_NAME}} - Nabis Invoice {{INVOICE_NUMBER}} - 40+ Days Past Due - ACTION REQUIRED

    ESCALATION DESIGN (IMPROVED - this was previously identical to 30+ and 50+):
    - This is the SECOND Past Due tier: urgency increases significantly
    - "Second notice" language replaces "friendly reminder"
    - Specific OCM deadline calculated and shown: "{{DAYS_UNTIL_OCM_REPORT}} days"
    - NEW: Mentions potential account hold on future orders
    - NEW: Requests payment by a specific deadline date
    - "We request immediate attention" replaces "we kindly ask"
    - Empathy language reduced from T3 ("oversights happen" removed)
    - Partnership language maintained but urgency dominates

    KEY DIFFERENCES FROM 30+ DAYS (T3):
    - Subject line adds "ACTION REQUIRED" suffix
    - "Second notice" framing
    - Specific countdown to OCM reporting
    - Account hold warning introduced
    - Explicit payment deadline date requested
    - Shorter empathy, more direct ask
